A program to perform and demonstrate an election proccess, 
given as an assignment and part of the C++ & Object Oriented coding course during my 2nd year as a CS student

By the name of the course, the main feature is implementing object oriented ideas and methods such as Inheritence and Polymorphism into this project.
Note that this is the second stage of a 3-stage rolling project.

The 3rd and final version of this project can be found on my project partner's github account, with some added features, in the link below:
